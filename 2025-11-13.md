## November 13 2025
- I had a brainstorming call with a fellow UX Designer we are going to collab on designs and branding
- I'm working on submitting a grant
- I had a great day, I'm going to review my book before bed and wake up early to get through a few more chapters

- I'm looking forward to Friday hosting a co-working day with creators and builders then going to an art gallery.
- I'm thankful for a new project I'm starting this week that will provide me with more resources to edit content and ship new products.
  ## Next Steps
  Read Chapters of my book this weekend!
